# SSB

EXP NO: 3	SSB-SC-AM MODULATION using SCILAB

AIM:

To write a program to perform SSBSC modulation and demodulation using SCI LAB and study its spectral characteristics

EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED

•	Computer with i3 Processor

•	SCI LAB

Note: Keep all the switch faults in off position


Algorithm
1.	Define Parameters:
•	Fs: Sampling frequency.
•	T: Duration of the signal.
•	Fc: Carrier frequency.
•	Fm: Frequency of the message signal.
•	Amplitude: Maximum amplitude of the message signal.
2.	Generate Signals:
•	Message Signal: The baseband signal that will be modulated.
•	Carrier Signal: A high-frequency signal used for modulation.
•	Analytic Signal: Constructed using the Hilbert transform to get the in-phase and quadrature components.
3.	SSBSC Modulation:
•	Modulated Signal: Create the SSBSC signal using the in-phase and quadrature components, modulated by the carrier.
4.	SSBSC Demodulation:
•	Mixing: Multiply the SSBSC signal with the carrier to retrieve the message signal.
•	Low-pass Filtering: Apply a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency components and recover the original message signal.
5.	Visualization:
•	Plot the message signal, carrier signal, SSBSC modulated signal, and the recovered signal after demodulation.


PROCEDURE

•	Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment.
•	Open SCILAB in System
•	Type your code in New Editor
•	Save the file
 
•	Execute the code
•	If any Error, correct it in code and execute again
•	Verify the generated waveform using Tabulation and Model Waveform
